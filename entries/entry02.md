## How I've Been Learning PyGame
<!-- Evidence: code snippets, screenshots, etc -->

Over the past month, since my last blog entry, I have been learning PyGame by first going over and practicing on the regular Python basics and commands and all of that sort. I've been using the website [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp) as my place to practice and learn the programming language, and have currently completed 65 of out the 95 excercise they have onsite. Currently, I am currently on their lesson about if and else statements, but I've noticed while doing the excercises is that Python is similar to Java and Javascript, in the commands that are used, but they're done in a different (much simpler) way in Python; which can be very confusing sometimes when coming over from Java to Python.

### For example:

- Equals: a == b
- Not Equals: a != b
- Less than: a < b
- Less than or equal to: a <= b
- Greater than: a > b
- Greater than or equal to: a >= b


These have the same functions as they do in both Java and Javascript, but there are some differences. As shown below:


```py In Python:
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")
```

```In Java:
int a = 33;
int b = 33;
if(b > a){
System.out.print("b is greater than a");
}
else if(a == b){
System.out.print("a and b are equal");
}
else{
System.out.print("a is greater than b");
}
```

Some of the differences are: 
 - In the first code block, you can see that it is not nessesary to declare variables as you would in Java/Script. So no needing to use declaration (int, double, String, etc.)
 - No use of "()". I don't need to write the statement in a set of parenthesis 


```py
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)
```


## My Goal for Break
 
My goal during my break is to mostly catch up on sleep, drink more water, and workout more. I also would like to learn tricks and shortcuts while learning my tool as well as attempt to begin working on it. I haven't fully decided exactly what I would like to make at the current moment, but I'm going along the lines of an 2d open-world game with interactable items and game mechanics. Hoping to figure out and create a plan for starting my project.
