# Entry 3 - My Plan Into Motion
##### 2/8/23

### Catch up
So first off, if it wasn't stated before, I'll state it again. I am creating a game platformer game using the Python coding library PyGame. I am working on creating a shooter with weapon mechanics and all that sort of good stuff. Currently, the only thing that I've done so far was a creat a title screen menu (Which is totally not broken at all btw (: ). 

### How was it done?

Well, first I needed to create a loop for the menu to stay running and showing you the content. So first, I have 3 files I used for this process [main.py, game.py, & menu.py].
