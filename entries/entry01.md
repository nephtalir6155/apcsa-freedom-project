## Content

Currently, I am beggining my process on studying a tool to use for my project. The tool I selected was PyGame for Python. I chose this tool because I wanted to learn another language that I could pair and partner up with Java while keeping the complexity on the more milder side. I plan to make a video game. Most likely a 2d platformer as PyGame wasn't made with 3d capabilities, so making a 3d game would be very tasking and difficult. 

## Sources

As for my resources to look through and learn. I looked at:
- [realpython.com](https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/) 
- [pythonprogramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net/pygame-python-3-part-1-intro/)

I've read through these to see exactly how I would start using and implementing PyGame into my work as well as to help me formulate idea on what exactly should I create. I learned: 

- Draw items on your screen
- Play sound effects and music
- Handle user input
- Implement event loops
- Describe how game programming differs from standard procedural Python programming

These are another website and even some videos I looked through for inspiration:

- [Learn Python by Building Five Games - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGf2GcyHPhc)
- [How To Use PyGame For Game Development](https://www.activestate.com/blog/how-to-use-pygame-for-game-development/)
- [How to create a Zelda style game in python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwWi05Icpw0)  
###### ^the tutorial that's most inpirational to me^
- [Python Pygame Zelda Game Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRrMsxQCiJg)

## EDP

In the beggining stage of my project. So not much for my engineering design process as of the moment.

## Skills

Two skills I'd say I developed from the time of my last FP has been on how I Google and embracing failure.
When I fail, I accept it and keep on trying until success. If I can't succeed in what I am doing, I use my developed Googling skills to find something that can help me. Either a site, video, or article that can show me the correct steps on how to solve the problem.
