## What I've Done

So far in the process of creating my game, I've completed each of the following:
- Creating the player
- Keyboard inputs
- Sprite animation `(os)`
- Weapons and effects

These are what I've worked on so far and now I'm going to explain a bit of what was done for each portion. So now let us dive a bit into the process of each part. 

### Creating the Player

<br>Here is where we define our variables for the display size and set the movement, shooting, and grenade vals. They're set to false as so the character isn't moving on it's on own
<br>

<br> We create a player with a rectangular shape, represented by a Rect object. We set the player's position, size, color, and speed. In the game loop, we handle user input to move the player left and right using the arrow keys, and we redraw the player on the screen with each iteration of the loop.
