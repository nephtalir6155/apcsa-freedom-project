## What I've Done

So far in the process of creating my game, I've completed each of the following:
- Creating the player & keyboard inputs
- Sprite Animation `(os)`
- Weapons and effects
- Collectables
- Ai `(random func)`
- Level loading `(csv files)`

These are what I've worked on so far and now I'm going to explain a bit of what was done for each portion.
